- how to pass db to inner instances, maybe pass container instead and services pick what they need?
- all numbers are floats only (as JSON unmarshal converts it to floats, so ints are not used anywhere)
- benchmark test, memory profiling
- add time constraints (global window, set window)
- come up with a design for exploring matched sequences. After the pattern match, how can we process the sequences of events?

Notes:
- it assumes all time stamps are in NANOSECONDS
- it assumes events are ordered in time
- "event a then <window> event b" - window is calculated from the last matched event in the previous set
