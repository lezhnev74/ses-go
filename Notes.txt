- how to pass db to inner instances, maybe pass container instead and services pick what they need?
- all numbers are floats only (as JSON unmarshal converts it to floats, so ints are not used anywhere)
- benchmark test, memory profiling
- add time constraints
- come up with a design for exploring matched sequences. After the pattern match, how can we process the sequences of events?

Important:
- assume all time stamps are in NANOSECONDS
